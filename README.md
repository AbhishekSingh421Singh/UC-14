# Semantic Search over Large Documents

## Introduction
In today's digital age, we often deal with large text files such as PDFs, logs, or articles. Searching through these documents using traditional keyword-based methods can be inefficient and may not yield the desired results. Semantic search, which finds information based on meaning rather than exact words, offers a powerful solution. This document outlines a use case for implementing semantic search over large documents stored in AWS S3, using OpenAI embeddings and PostgreSQL with pgvector.

## Tools Used
### AWS S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a scalable object storage service that allows you to store and retrieve large amounts of data, including text files.

### Python
Python is a versatile programming language used to write the code for this use case.

### OpenAI / HuggingFace
These AI services are used to generate embeddings, which are high-dimensional vectors that capture the semantic meaning of text.

### PostgreSQL + pgvector
PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database system. The pgvector extension allows PostgreSQL to store and perform similarity searches on vector embeddings.

### Libraries
- `boto3`: AWS SDK for Python, used to interact with AWS S3.
- `nltk` or `tiktoken`: Libraries used to tokenize and chunk text.
- `psycopg2`: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
- `openai`: Library to interact with OpenAI's API.

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Download File from S3
Use `boto3` to fetch the file from your S3 bucket.

### Step 2: Extract and Chunk Text
Use a library like `PyMuPDF` or `pdfminer` to read PDFs, and `nltk` or `tiktoken` to split the text into chunks (e.g., 500 tokens each).

### Step 3: Generate Embeddings
Use OpenAI or HuggingFace to convert each chunk into a vector (embedding).

### Step 4: Store in PostgreSQL
Use `pgvector` to store the text and its vector in a PostgreSQL table.

### Step 5: Search
When a user asks a question:
- Convert the question into a vector.
- Search the database for the most similar vectors.
- Return the matching text.

## Benefits
- Enables context-aware search (e.g., finding relevant paragraphs even if they donâ€™t contain the exact keywords).
- Scales well with large documents.
- Can be integrated into chatbots, knowledge bases, or internal search tools.

## Conclusion
Implementing semantic search over large documents using AWS S3, OpenAI embeddings, and PostgreSQL with pgvector provides a powerful and efficient way to find relevant information based on meaning rather than exact words. This approach can greatly enhance the search capabilities of various applications, making it easier to find and utilize valuable information.
